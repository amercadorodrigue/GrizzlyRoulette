# Grizzly Roulette

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is the final project for my Mobile Application Development class, Spring 2021.
The app allows the user to create a list of names to later select a name randomly. The user can 
remove or a hide a name and clear, shuffle, or a sort the list.
